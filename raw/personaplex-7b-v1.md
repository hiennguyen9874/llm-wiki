### Description:
Personaplex is a real-time speech-to-speech conversational model that jointly performs streaming speech understanding and speech generation. The model operates on continuous audio encoded with a neural codec and predicts both text tokens and audio tokens autoregressively to produce its spoken responses. Incoming user audio is incrementally encoded and fed to the model while Personaplex simultaneously generates its own outgoing speech, enabling natural conversational dynamics such as interruptions, barge-ins, overlaps, and rapid turn-taking.
Personaplex runs in a dual-stream configuration in which listening and speaking occur concurrently. This design allows the model to update its internal state based on the user’s ongoing speech while still producing fluent output audio, supporting highly interactive conversations.
Before the conversation begins, Personaplex is conditioned on two prompts: a voice prompt and a text prompt. The voice prompt consists of a sequence of audio tokens that establish the target vocal characteristics and speaking style. The text prompt specifies persona attributes such as role, background, and scenario context. Together, these prompts define the model's conversational identity and guide its linguistic and acoustic behavior throughout the interaction.

This model is ready for commercial use.
