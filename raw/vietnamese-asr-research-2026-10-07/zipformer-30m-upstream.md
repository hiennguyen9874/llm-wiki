# Vietnamese Speech-to-Text (ASR) — ZipFormer-30M-RNNT-6000h

## 🔍 Overview
The **Vietnamese Speech-to-Text (ASR)** model is built on the **ZipFormer architecture** — an improved variant of the Conformer — featuring only **30 million parameters** yet achieving **exceptional performance** in both speed and accuracy.  
On CPU, the model can transcribe a **12-second audio clip in just 0.3 seconds**, significantly faster than most traditional ASR systems without requiring a GPU.

## ☕ Give Me a Coffee for Training Cost

This model was trained entirely on **self-funded, personal hardware** — every GPU hour and electricity bill came out of my own pocket.  
If this work is useful to you, a small contribution helps cover the cost of the next training run and keeps future models free and open. Every coffee is hugely appreciated 🙏

## ⚙️ Model Architecture and Training strategy:
- **Architecture:** ZipFormer  
- **Parameters:** ~30M  
- **Language:** Vietnamese  
- **Loss Function:** RNN-Transducer (RNNT Loss)  
- **Framework:** PyTorch + k2
- **Training strategy**: Carefully preprocess the data, apply an augmentation strategy based on the distribution of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) tokens and refine the transcriptions using Whisper.  
- **Optimized for:** High-speed CPU inference
