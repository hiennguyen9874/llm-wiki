# huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-GGUF


This is an uncensored version of [Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) created with abliteration (see [remove-refusals-with-transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers) to know more about it).
This is a crude, proof-of-concept implementation to remove refusals from an LLM model without using TransformerLens.

## Latest update 7

The newly added **Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-Swift** series come from [ukisai/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/ukisai/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-GGUF). 
Only layers **22 to 52 (0-based indexing)** have been ablated, while the other layers remain unablated. It may come with a small disclaimer warning.
This is just a test/validation.

## Latest update 6

The newly added **Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-Ternary** series come from [prism-ml/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-gguf](https://huggingface.co/prism-ml/Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-gguf
). 
Only layers **22 to 52 (0-based indexing)** have been ablated, while the other layers remain unablated. It may come with a small disclaimer warning.
The size after conversion may differ from the original GGUF (Some of the weights are converted from PTQ1 to Q2_K or Q3_K.).
This is just a test/validation.

The ternary hybrid-attention kernels live in the
[PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp](https://github.com/PrismML-Eng/llama.cpp) fork. **Stock llama.cpp will not run these files.**

The newly added **Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-GSQ-RCO** series come from [ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-27B-GSQ-RCO-GGUF
). 
Only layers **22 to 52 (0-based indexing)** have been ablated, while the other layers remain unablated. It may come with a small disclaimer warning.
The size after conversion may differ from the original GGUF.

## Latest update 4

The newly added **Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-UD-DW** series come from [unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF). 
Only layers **22 to 52 (0-based indexing)** have been ablated, while the other layers remain unablated. It may come with a small disclaimer warning.
The size after conversion may differ from the original GGUF.

## Latest update

The newly added **Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-UD** series come from [unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF). 
Only layers **17 to 52 (0-based indexing)** have been ablated(Previously, The first 15 layers were retained without ablation), while the other layers remain unablated. 
The size after conversion may differ from the original GGUF.

Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated-bf16.gguf has also been updated.

This helps retain more of the original model’s performance. MTP and visual has not been modified.

## Note
The first 15 layers were retained without ablation. MTP and visual has not been modified.

We have already converted the weights (token_embd,output,ffn_down,ssm_out,attn_output) that need to be ablated in the versions below Q8_0 from Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, and Q6_K to Q8_0 to improve response quality, and changed the filename to K_L.

In the Q8_0 quantized version, we changed the Q8_0 weights (token_embd,output,ffn_down,ssm_out,attn_output) targeted for ablation to BF16 and renamed the file to Q8_0_L.

This is not a standard quantization, so you might find that Q2_K_L is larger than Q3_K and Q4_K.

## Specific Quantification Method 
Some people may misunderstand. The specific quantification method is as follows.

### Q2_K_L - Q6_K_L
