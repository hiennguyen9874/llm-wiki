# Nemotron OCR v2

## **Model Overview**

### **Description**

Nemotron OCR v2 is a state-of-the-art multilingual text recognition model designed for robust end-to-end optical character recognition (OCR) on complex real-world images. It integrates three core neural network modules: a detector for text region localization, a recognizer for transcription of detected regions, and a relational model for layout and structure analysis.

This model is optimized for a wide variety of OCR tasks, including multi-line, multi-block, and natural scene text, and it supports advanced reading order analysis via its relational model component. Nemotron OCR v2 supports multiple languages and has been developed to be production-ready and commercially usable, with a focus on speed and accuracy on both document and natural scene images.

Nemotron OCR v2 is part of the NVIDIA NeMo Retriever collection, which provides state-of-the-art, commercially-ready models and microservices optimized for the lowest latency and highest throughput. It features a production-ready information retrieval pipeline with enterprise support. The models that form the core of this solution have been trained using responsibly selected, auditable data sources. With multiple pre-trained models available as starting points, developers can readily customize them for domain-specific use cases, such as information technology, human resource help assistants, and research and development assistants.

This model is ready for commercial use.

### Deployment Geography

Global

### Use Case

**Nemotron OCR v2** is designed for high-accuracy and high-speed extraction of textual information from images across multiple languages, making it ideal for powering multimodal retrieval systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, and agentic applications that require seamless integration of visual and language understanding. Its robust multilingual performance and efficiency make it an excellent choice for next-generation AI systems that demand both precision and scalability across diverse real-world content.

### **Model Architecture**

**Architecture Type:** Hybrid detector-recognizer with document-level relational modeling

Nemotron OCR v2 is available in two variants:

- **v2_english** — Optimized for English-language OCR with word-level region handling.
- **v2_multilingual** — Supports English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, and Russian with line-level region handling for multilingual documents.

Both variants share the same three-component architecture:

- **Text Detector:** Utilizes a RegNetX-8GF convolutional backbone for high-accuracy localization of text regions within images.
- **Text Recognizer:** Employs a pre-norm Transformer-based sequence recognizer to transcribe text from detected regions, supporting variable word and line lengths.
- **Relational Model:** Applies a multi-layer global relational module to predict logical groupings, reading order, and layout relationships across detected text elements.

All components are trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion, providing robust, scalable, and production-ready OCR for diverse document and scene images.

**Network Architecture**: RegNetX-8GF

Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.


### Usage

#### Prerequisites

- **OS**: Linux amd64 with NVIDIA GPU
- **CUDA toolkit** with `nvcc` on `PATH`. The toolkit version must be compatible with
  the version of PyTorch you install (same major version). For example, if you install
  `torch` with CUDA 12.8 bindings, you need CUDA toolkit 12.x. Verify with
  `nvcc --version` and `nvidia-smi`.
- **Python**: 3.12 (the package requires `>=3.12,<3.13`)
- **Build tools** (for the C++ CUDA extension compiled at install time):
  - GCC/G++ with C++17 support
  - CUDA toolkit headers
  - OpenMP

#### Installation
The package includes a C++ CUDA extension that is compiled during installation.
Because the extension must be built against the **same PyTorch CUDA version** as
your system's CUDA toolkit, **install PyTorch first**, then install this package
with `--no-build-isolation` so it uses your existing PyTorch.

1. Clone the repository

- Make sure git-lfs is installed (https://git-lfs.com)
```
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2
```

2. Installation

##### With pip

- Create and activate a Python 3.12 environment
- Install PyTorch matching your CUDA toolkit (see https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/):

```bash
# Example for CUDA 12.8:
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

- Install the package:

```bash
cd nemotron-ocr
pip install --no-build-isolation -v .
```

- Verify the C++ extension loads:

```bash
python -c "from nemotron_ocr.inference.pipeline_v2 import NemotronOCRV2; print('OK')"
```

##### With docker

Run the example end-to-end without installing anything on the host (besides Docker, docker compose, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit):

- Ensure Docker can see your GPU:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.09-py3 nvidia-smi
```

- From the repo root, bring up the service to run the example (sample image `ocr-example-input-1.png` when present):

```bash
docker compose run --rm nemotron-ocr \
  bash -lc "python example.py ocr-example-input-1.png --merge-level paragraph"
```

This will:
- Build an image from the provided `Dockerfile` (based on `nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch`)
- Mount the repo at `/workspace`
- Run `example.py` (downloads **v2 multilingual** from Hugging Face on first run unless you pass `--model-dir`)

Output is saved next to your input image as `<name>-annotated.<ext>` on the host.


3. Run the model using the following code.

Use `nemotron_ocr.inference.pipeline_v2.NemotronOCRV2`. With no arguments, checkpoints are downloaded from Hugging Face: **by default** the **v2 multilingual** bundle (`nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2` / `v2_multilingual/`). Use `lang="en"` for the English v2 build (`nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2` / `v2_english/`), or pass `model_dir` to load from disk (any complete checkpoint folder; `lang` is then ignored).

```python
from nemotron_ocr.inference.pipeline_v2 import NemotronOCRV2

# Default: Hugging Face v2 multilingual
ocr = NemotronOCRV2()

# English v2 (Hub, word-level)
ocr_en = NemotronOCRV2(lang="en")

# Multilingual v2 explicitly (same default as NemotronOCRV2())
# Uses the line-level variant.
ocr_multi = NemotronOCRV2(lang="multi")

# Local directory with detector.pth, recognizer.pth, relational.pth, charset.txt
ocr_local = NemotronOCRV2(model_dir="./v2_multilingual")

predictions = ocr("ocr-example-input-1.png")

for pred in predictions:
    print(
        f"  - Text: '{pred['text']}', "
        f"Confidence: {pred['confidence']:.2f}, "
        f"Bbox: [left={pred['left']:.4f}, upper={pred['upper']:.4f}, right={pred['right']:.4f}, lower={pred['lower']:.4f}]"
    )
```

#### Inference modes

```python
# Detector only — returns bounding boxes without text recognition.
# Loads only the detector (~37% less GPU memory, ~20% faster).
ocr_det = NemotronOCRV2(detector_only=True)
boxes = ocr_det("page.png")
# Each prediction has: confidence, left, right, upper, lower, quad

# Skip relational — returns per-word text without reading-order grouping.
# Skips the relational model (~35% less GPU memory, ~8% faster).
ocr_fast = NemotronOCRV2(skip_relational=True)
words = ocr_fast("page.png", merge_level="word")
# Each prediction has: text, confidence, left, right, upper, lower

# Profiling mode — enables per-phase CUDA-synced timing in the logs.
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
ocr_profile = NemotronOCRV2(verbose_post=True)
```

**Constructor rules**

- You can choose model weights with either **`lang`** or **`model_dir`**.
- **`lang`** (keyword only, Hub download path):
  - `None`, `"multi"`, or `"multilingual"` -> **v2 multilingual** (default): `nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2` / `v2_multilingual/`
  - `"en"` or `"english"` -> **v2 English**: `nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v2` / `v2_english/`
  - `"v1"` or `"legacy"` -> **v1 English-only** (backward compatibility): fetched from `nvidia/nemotron-ocr-v1` if not already cached locally
  - Both v2 variants (`v2_multilingual/` and `v2_english/`) are included in this repository.
- **`model_dir`** (local override): if it points to a complete local checkpoint directory (`detector.pth`, `recognizer.pth`, `relational.pth`, `charset.txt`), it takes precedence and **overrides `lang`**.
- If `model_dir` is provided but incomplete, loading falls back to Hub resolution via **`lang`** (defaulting to v2 multilingual when `lang` is `None`).
