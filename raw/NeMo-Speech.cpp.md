## Performance

NeMo-Speech.cpp is blazing fast and built for real-time streaming. Speech recognition
transcribes audio in 160 ms chunks up to 67× faster than real time, and speech synthesis
generates speech up to 60× faster than real time with its first audio in under 10 ms. Both stay
faster than real time even on a CPU.

Streaming speech recognition with Nemotron Speech Streaming 0.6B (Q8_0), 160 ms chunks:

| Device | Latency per chunk | Throughput | Speedup over NeMo (FP32) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| GeForce RTX 4090 | **2.3 ms** | **67× real time** | **8.8×** |
| CPU | **27 ms** | **6× real time** | **3.7×** |

Streaming speech synthesis with MagpieTTS Multilingual (Q8_0), 186 ms audio chunks:

| Device | Time to first audio | Inter-chunk latency | Throughput | Speedup over NeMo (FP32) |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| GeForce RTX 4090 | **9 ms** | **3 ms** | **60× real time** | **40×** |
| CPU | **203 ms** | **64 ms** | **2.7× real time** | **9.7×** |

See [BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md) for the methodology and more results.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **For the best performance, build natively from source.** A native build is compiled for
> your machine. Tagged releases are cut periodically and can trail the `main` branch; for
> prebuilt binaries of the latest `main`, pass `--channel nightly` (`-Channel nightly` on
> Windows) to install the nightly prerelease, which is rebuilt daily. See
> [Build from source](#build-from-source).

Install the `nemo-speech` CLI for the detected platform and backend:

On Linux or macOS, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Speech.cpp/raw/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Open a new shell after installation so the updated user `PATH` takes effect.

On Windows, run from PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Speech.cpp/raw/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Open a new PowerShell window after installation so the updated user `PATH`
takes effect.

The installer downloads the prebuilt archive for the latest release, checks it
against the SHA-256 checksum published with the release, and builds from source
when no archive is available for your platform. **Pass `--source` (`-Source` on
Windows) to always build from the `main` branch.** A source build requires Git,
CMake 3.26 or newer, Ninja, a C++17 compiler, SentencePiece development files,
and the toolchain required by the selected backend, if any. See
[Installation](docs/install.md) for platform-specific prerequisites and
options.

## Quick start

Transcribe a local WAV file. On first use, the CLI downloads the pinned default
Nemotron 3.5 GGUF from Hugging Face and verifies its size and SHA-256:

```bash
nemo-speech transcribe /path/to/audio.wav
```

Source checkouts can use `test_files/asr/wav/test/jfk.wav` as a smoke-test
input.

The same command can transcribe the default microphone on builds that include
live capture:

```bash
nemo-speech transcribe --live
```

Run `nemo-speech model list` to see defaults, short names, and which command
uses each model. For example, `nemo-speech pull nemotron-en` downloads the
English-only model ahead of time, and `--model nemotron-en` selects it. Local
GGUF paths continue to work without downloading anything. The CLI selects an
available backend and handles common mono or stereo PCM WAV sample rates
automatically. See the [CLI model guide](docs/cli.md#models-and-cache) and
[model conversion](docs/model-conversion.md) for custom checkpoints.

## Command line

The CLI is the primary interface. Run `nemo-speech --help` to see the
capabilities included in your build. The [CLI guide](docs/cli.md) covers model
selection, GPU controls, directory transcription, subtitles, diarization,
translation, synthesis, structured output, and benchmarking. The
[VoiceChat guide](docs/s2s/README.md) covers building and serving the realtime
pipeline.

## Local server and playground

Start the same runtime as a local HTTP service and open the playground:

```bash
nemo-speech serve \
  --asr-model nemotron-3.5 \
  --open
```

The server binds to <http://127.0.0.1:8080> by default. Its transcription and
speech routes expose documented OpenAI-compatible subsets, alongside realtime
WebSocket transcription and realtime VoiceChat when its model is loaded. A
separately built `riva_server` binary provides the ASR, TTS, and translation
gRPC interfaces. See the [server guide](docs/server.md) when you are ready to
integrate either frontend.

## Native SDK

Release archives include stable C headers, shared libraries, and an exported
CMake package. An installed application can link only the capability it uses:

```cmake
find_package(NeMoSpeech REQUIRED COMPONENTS ASR)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE NeMoSpeech::ASR)
```

See [native SDK integration](docs/sdk.md) for in-process C/C++ usage, or
[client integration](docs/clients.md) for OpenAI SDK, curl, and Riva-compatible
gRPC usage.

## Build from source

Requires CMake 3.26 or newer, Ninja, C and C++17 compilers, SentencePiece
development files, and the toolchain required by the selected backend, if any.
For a CUDA ASR and TTS server with the playground:

```bash
git submodule update --init llama.cpp third_party/cpp-httplib
scripts/configure.sh cuda-server
cmake --build --preset cuda-server
```

The configuration helper validates required submodules and applies the pinned
ggml patch series for CUDA builds. CPU, Metal, Vulkan, server, component,
Windows, and container instructions are in
[Build from source](docs/build.md).
